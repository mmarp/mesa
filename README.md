# MESA

#### _Full Stack Web App project

Splitting your bill was never that easy!

## Introduction


Do you know when you go to a restaurant, with a group of friends or colleagues, and everyone orders different things? Some people eat a lot and some not as much. By the end of the dinner, the bill arrives and most of the times we end up dividing the bill equally. That happens mostly because, when in this situation people are uncomfortable to say they want to pay only for what they ate. And when they do, someone or everyone has to check the bill and calculate manually on their phone how much is their total.


Having this in mind, we created Mesa, and we hope that those days are over. Mesa is a Full Stack Web App that handles your bill in a democratic way. It allows you to store the information of your table, by adding a group of friends, choosing a restaurant and adding the dishes you ate. After that you are able to choose to divide the bill equally as before, or you can choose which dishes you ate yourself. Also, if you ate them alone or if you divide them with more people. Like a bottle of wine for example. And it calculates your individual total. Furthermore, it allows people to pay through the app, and in different times. Because sometimes you need to leave earlier.




MESA uses React.js with Axios, Node.js with Express.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, HTML and CSS with Bootstrap.
